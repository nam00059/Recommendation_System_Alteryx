## Intructions for setup:

**Snowflake Setup:**  
   - Store your transaction data in **Snowflake**.  
     📂 Data link: [Instacart Market Basket Analysis Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)  
   - Configure Alteryx In-DB tools with appropriate credentials.  
   - _(Alternatively, download files from Kaggle and read them directly into Alteryx if you don't want to connect with Snowflake)._

2. **Alteryx Workflow Execution:**  
   - Run the Alteryx workflow to preprocess data and generate association rules.
   - Export the final results (CSV / Parquet) for use in the Streamlit app.

3. **Streamlit Application:**  
   - Use `instacart.py` to run the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run instacart.py
     ```
   - Make sure the data file generated from Alteryx is available in the app’s expected path.
